# Serum on Akash

This is a guide to containerizing [Serum DEX](https://github.com/project-serum/serum-dex-ui) and deploying on [Akash](https://akash.network) in a non-custodial way. Akash is a permissionless and censorship-resistant cloud network that guarantees sovereignty over your data and your applications. With Akash, youâ€™re in complete control of all aspects of the life cycle of an application with no middleman.

## Before We Begin

This is a technical guide, best suited to a reader with basic Linux command line knowledge. The audience for this guide is intended for includes:

* Application developers with little or no systems administration experience, wanting to deploy applications on the decentralized cloud.
* System administrators with little or no experience with infrastructure automation, wanting to learn more.
* Infrastructure automation engineers that want to explore decentralized cloud.
* Anyone who wants to get a feel for the current state of the decentralized cloud ecosystem.

You will need the below setup before we being:

1) Install Akash: Make sure to have Akash client installed on your workstation, check [install guide](https://docs.akash.network/guides/install) for instructions.
